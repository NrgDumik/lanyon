## Business Model
Fluence is a decentralized encrypted database for sensitive data, which is secured by blockchain technologies. It makes possible creating decentralized apps where users control their data, can share and monetize it. Like traditional NoSQL database, Fluence allows to execute data queries, update or delete data.  
### Token Distribution Information:  
Fluence tokens (FLU) are an ERC-20 token that is distributed via an Ethereum smart contract. Any FPT tokens acquired during the pre-sale will be exchanged into FLU tokens after the crowdsale has been complete. The current crowdsale date has not yet been announced, but the team is aiming for Q4.
It is important to note that there is another token, Fluence Functional Token (FFT), that runs on the internal Fluence blockchain and is used as a reward for those running nodes. The price of the token is set at roughly $1, so that those who are running nodes for the network do not have to worry about volatility.  
### Pre-sale Information:  
The pre-sale will begin on August 14. The pre-sale will sell FPT, which are exchanged for Fluence tokens (FLU) at a rate of 1 FPT:1 FLU after the crowdsale has been completed.
There are a total of 6,000,000 FLU tokens available during the pre-sale and the bonus structure during the pre-sale is as follows:
* 1 Ether = 1,500 FPT (if contributing less than 5 Ether)  
* 1 Ether = 2,250 FPT (if contributing between 5â€“100 Ether)  
* 1 Ether= 3,000 FPT (if contributing over 100 Ether)
