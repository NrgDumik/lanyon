## Business Model
FairCoin is a part of FairCoop, a free worldwide cooperative that organizes itself through the web, outside the limits and controls of the State, as the group aims at create an alternative global economy based on ethic and solidarity, reducing financial and social differences among people. 
What really makes Faircoin different from other currencies is its specific use as a tool for FairCoop: this cryptocurrency acts as a FairCoop value’s reserve and redistribution of capital in socially and environmentally coherent projects.
Faircoin aims at overcoming the limitations of social currencies that are designed for local use and not interconnected as they are still related to fiduciary money and can suffer the same ups and downs.
