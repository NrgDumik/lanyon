## Business Model
The digital loyalty solution being developed by BitScan has been designed to meet
these critical requirements. In acknowledgement of its potential to incentivise valued
behaviour in the broadest sense, Incent has been chosen as the name of both the
project and the digital reward currency we propose.
At its core, Project Incent demands a partnership between a blockchain platform
provider, to facilitate the creation, distribution, security and decentralised accounting of
the currency itself, and BitScan to develop and operate the applications necessary to
give the currency commercial utility.
