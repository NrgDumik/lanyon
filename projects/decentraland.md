## Business Model
Decentraland is a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications.  
The core ownership mechanism of Decentraland is an Ethereum smart contract that verifies the ownership of each parcel of land. While LAND is a non-fungible asset within Decentraland, users can purchase LAND at a fixed cost of 1,000 MANA.
MANA is a fungible ERC-20 token that will be sold during the Decentraland ICO and continuously sold to users thereafter. MANA used to purchase the land are destroyed as a function of the LAND registry smart contract. In addition, MANA can be used to purchase services and items within the virtual world.
