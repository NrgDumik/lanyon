## Business Model
Cloudwith.me states that there is an opportunity in the blockchain world to create the first complete solution that will allow both cloud storage and cloud applications to run decentralized on the Blockchain.
Cloudwith.me has three main objectives:  
* To decentralize the provisioning of cloud services, migrating from a global infrastructure operated by a small group of hyperscale service providers to a blockchain-based peer-to-peer infrastructure operated by millions of small individual providers and contributors of cloud resources.
* To simplify the use of professional cloud services for all levels of web users turning such services into a commodity product universally accessible and utilized by the general public.
* To monetize the new decentralized cloud services ecosystem with a dedicated cryptocurrency governed by a smart contract enabling automated and trusted reconciliation of payments between all peer-to-peer cloud services providers.
