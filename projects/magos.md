## Business Model
Magos is a complex forecasting model based on a system of neural networks.Each network performs a specific task, and their collaboration produces a
forecast with a high degree of accuracy. The backbone of Magos is its modular architecture. It allows to develop and implement individual forecasting
modules, targeting different kinds of forecasting domains, from business and finance to sports and politics.  
Magos token (MAG) performs two types of functions in the system: it allows holders to receive dividends from all fund operations, and gives them
voting rights in project's development through a voting mechanism on the blockchain.
