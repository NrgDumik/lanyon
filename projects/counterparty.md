## Business Model
Counterparty extends Bitcoin’s functionality by “writing in the margins” of regular Bitcoin transactions, 
opening the door for innovation and advanced features not possible with ordinary Bitcoin software. 
XCP is used to provide functionality where it isn’t technically possible to use BTC. 
For instance, XCP is the currency used to pay for the execution of all smart contract code. 
More generally, XCP represents stake in the Counterparty protocol, and is the voting currency for changes 
to be decided on by the community.
