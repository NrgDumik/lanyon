  Name: Bitcoin Cash
  [Website](https://www.bitcoincash.org/)  
  Year founded: Aug 2017  
  Currency: coin [BCH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/)  
## Business Model
   Bitcoin Cash is a split from Bitcoin with a protocol upgrade to fix on-chain capacity. If Bitcoin Cash gets majority of PoW then it becomes de facto Bitcoin.
It will be a Bitcoin without segwit as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks, without changing the economic rules of the Bitcoin.
