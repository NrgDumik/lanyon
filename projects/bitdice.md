## Business Model  	
Established in 2014, BitDice is a profitably operating and presently the largest crowdfunded cryptocurrency casino. They gained over 2300 BTC in profits and are now seeking to expand ourselves into the new USD 50 billion online casino market, which has not been previously accessible. Cryptocurrency gambling accounts for roughly 5% of the entire online gambling industry. By bringing and introducing the “provable fairness” concept that they use in all our games to eliminate “black box” phenomenon, they expect to get exposure to fiat players and win their trust. Along with integrating fiat betting with our cryptocurrency arm of the business, they’ll go through all the required regulatory procedures to have a solid legal standing.
