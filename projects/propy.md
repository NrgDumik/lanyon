## Business Model
Propy aims to solve the problems of the international real estate marketplace by creating a novel unified property store and asset transfer platform for the global real estate industry.  
The PRO token is central to Propy’s real-estate marketplace. The token will work as a method of settlement and for interacting with Propy’s registry. 
Users would initiate the writing of new data to the Propy registry via Propy’s interface, whether that data would result in the creation of new title, or transferring a title already recorded in the system  
Crowdsale Structure:  
* Total PRO tokens supply: 100M. Total PRO for sale: 35M  
* 1 PRO Token = $1.00  
* Bonus: 15% during the first hour, 10% during the following 23 hours  
* Funding cap: 35M  
* Cryptocurrencies accepted: Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and ICOCoin  
* There is no minimum for crowdsale participation  
* Tokens will be credited into your wallet in real-time  
* Withdrawal of tokens will be available after the crowdsale ends
