## About 
[Whitepaper](https://www.enigma.co/enigma_catalyst.pdf)  
 Through Catalyst, developers can access Enigmaâ€™s decentralized data marketplace protocol and consume valuable crypto-data that can be used in their strategies. Catalyst is therefore the first application to be deployed on top of the Enigma protocol.
