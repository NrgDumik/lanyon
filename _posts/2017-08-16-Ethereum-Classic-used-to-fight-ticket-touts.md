## Summary
There are many issues that plague events especially when events involve tickets and passes. One of the common issues with tickets is when scalpers, hoarders and touts are present. 

With the issues mentioned, the event ticketing market cannot hold off the purchasing of tickets, which often results in high price tickets and ruins the face value of some events. The events sometimes flop due to the unavailability of tickets due to them being hoarded or the prices of tickets being too high to purchase.

Blockchain technology helps track the ticket sold per person according to the rules set by the organizer. Once the tickets are sold, it cannot be resold by any third party.

Besides, tickets will be invalidated once an account is believed to be a ticket tout.

Ticketing is just one of the many industries taking advantage of Blockchain technology to disrupt their respective sectors. Various industries have been using Blockchain to solve common issues brought by manual and redundant processes easily optimized through Blockchain.
